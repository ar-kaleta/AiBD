Importable file with survey data was downloaded from fivethirtyeight data repository. It was supplied by fivethirtyeight in csv format. All the necessary information about the data and its source can be found in Metadata folder along with the original fivethirtyeight article. Data exploration and its results can be found in the Documents folder in The Data Appendix ipynb file. Data was analysed using Python and NumPy and Pandas libraries in Jupter Notebook on Windows 10 operating system. The code used is in Command Files folder in data_processing.ipynb file. Three columns were extracted from the original dataset - "Do you think the "Big One" will occur in your lifetime?", "Age" and "What is your gender?". The name of "Do you think the "Big One" will occur in your lifetime?" column was changed to "Outlook" and the name of "What is your age?" column was changed to "Age". Because there were only 12 rows with missing values, they were excluded. Processed file was saved in Command Files under the name processed_data.csv. Data was analysed, the code is available in Analysis data folder in the analysis.ipynb file. Data was grouped by Age and Gender to indicate the Outlook of certain demographies. The results can be found in the Documents folder in the Final Paper file.

To get the same results:
1. Run the data_processing.ipynb script in Command Files folder - this will yield processed_data.csv.
2. Copy the processed_data.csv to the same directory as analysis.ipynb script.
3. Run analysis.ipynb script.
4. The last output of analysis.ipynb script is the results of data analysis.
